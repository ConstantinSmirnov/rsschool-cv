CodeWars task example.
>Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.
It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

```arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]```

>If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

```arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]```

```javascript
function arrayDiff(firstArray, secondArray) {
  secondArray.forEach(secondArrayItem => {
        if (firstArray.find(firstArrayItem => firstArrayItem == secondArrayItem) !== undefined) {
            firstArray = firstArray.filter(item => item !== secondArrayItem)
        }
  })
